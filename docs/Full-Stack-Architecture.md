# Full-Stack Architecture for Iqra al-Quran

## 1. System Overview
This architecture designs a multi-platform Quran recitation and learning app, integrating frontend, backend, AI, and infrastructure for features like Mushaf layouts, AI voice search, mistake detection, and community elements.

## 2. Architecture Principles
- User-Centric: Start with recitation journeys.
- Pragmatic Tech: React/TypeScript for frontend, Python/Flask for backend, Expo for mobile.
- Scalable: Microservices for AI processing.
- Secure: Encrypt audio data.
- Performant: On-device AI where possible.

## 3. Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety.
- **Mobile**: Expo for Android/iOS development (replaces Capacitor for better dev experience and native features).
- **State Management**: React hooks for settings (e.g., Tajweed toggle).
- **UI Components**: Reusable for layouts and feedback.
- **Audio Handling**: Expo AV for recording/playback.

## 4. Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask for REST APIs.
- **Database**: SQLite for local, PostgreSQL for cloud.
- **APIs**: Endpoints for recitation analysis and user progress.
- **AI Integration**: ML models for mistake detection via Python libraries.

## 5. AI Integration
- **Models**: Whisper for speech recognition; custom for Tajweed rules.
- **Processing**: On-device for privacy, cloud for heavy computation.
- **Features**: Real-time matching, error highlighting.

## 6. Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker for containers, Railway for hosting.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for builds.
- **Monitoring**: Logs for performance.

## 7. Security
- **Data**: Encrypt audio; comply with privacy laws.
- **Access**: JWT for APIs.

## 8. Performance
- **Optimization**: Lazy loading for pages; caching for offline.

## 9. Mobile Development with Expo
- **Setup**: Use Expo CLI for dev environment.
- **Build**: Expo Application Services for Android/iOS builds.
- **Features**: Native audio, notifications, and branding via Expo config.
- **Integration**: Web fallback for non-mobile.

## 10. Next Steps
- Prototype AI endpoints.
- Integrate with existing components.
- Set up Expo dev for mobile stories.
