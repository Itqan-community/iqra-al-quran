# PRD Shard 4: Risks, Metrics, and Recommendations - Enhancing Iqra al-Quran with Quran Pages Features

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Integration challenges with existing components (e.g., audio-recorder.tsx). **Mitigation:** Conduct code reviews and use existing hooks for seamless updates.
- **Risk:** Performance issues on mobile devices. **Mitigation:** Optimize audio processing and test on low-end hardware early.
- **Risk:** Scope creep from premium features. **Mitigation:** Stick to MoSCoW priorities and gate non-essential items.
- **Risk:** User data privacy concerns. **Mitigation:** Align with existing security protocols and ensure compliance.

## 8. Success Metrics
- User engagement: Increase in daily active users for recitation features by 20%.
- Feature adoption: 80% of users utilizing at least one new Quran Reader or recitation tool within the first month.
- Performance: <5% crash rate on iOS/Android; layout switches complete in <2 seconds.
- Feedback: Positive ratings in app stores for new memorization aids.

## 9. Next Steps and Recommendations
- **Immediate:** Share this brief for team review and confirm any adjustments.
- **Short-Term:** Assign Linear tickets based on sprints; begin development with must-haves.
- **Recommendations:** Conduct user testing sessions for accessibility (e.g., Tajweed colors); explore partnerships for additional reciters if budget allows.
- **Open Questions:** Do we need to elicit more details on specific integrations or premium pricing models?

This project brief is structured for clarity and actionability. If you'd like to refine any section, run additional commands (e.g., *brainstorm for ideation), or proceed to documentation output, just let me knowâ€”I'm here to iterate collaboratively!
