# PRD Shard 3: Priorities and Timeline - Enhancing Iqra al-Quran with Quran Pages Features

## 5. MoSCoW Priorities
- **Must-Have:** Core Quran Reader features (layouts, Tajweed, basic translations) and essential recitation modes (AI voice search, follow-along) – critical for basic functionality.
- **Should-Have:** Mistake detection, color feedback, listening playback, goals/streaks – important for engagement but not launch-blocking.
- **Could-Have:** Premium features (historical mistakes, audio deletion), advanced community elements (leaderboards), and multi-language UI – nice-to-have for enhancement.
- **Won't-Have:** Desktop/web expansions beyond current setup, major backend overhauls, or unsupported Qirā'āt beyond Hafs ʽĀṣim.

## 6. Timeline (Linear-Formatted Delivery)
This timeline assumes a 12-week development cycle, broken into sprints for iterative delivery. Milestones align with MoSCoW priorities.

- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-3):** Planning & Must-Haves – Review codebase, draft user stories, implement core Quran Reader (layouts, Tajweed). Milestone: Basic layout switching functional.

- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 10-12):** Testing & Polish – Full testing, UI/UX refinements, documentation updates. Milestone: PRD complete, features verified, ready for review.
