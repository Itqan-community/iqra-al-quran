# PRD Shard 1: Overview and Scope - Enhancing Iqra al-Quran with Quran Pages Features

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Title:** Quran Pages Features Enhancement
**Prepared By:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

### Objective
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for adding advanced Quran page features to Iqra al-Quran, including user stories, testable acceptance criteria, MoSCoW priorities, and a Linear-formatted delivery timeline, based on the provided feature descriptions.

### Context Summary
The Iqra al-Quran project is a multi-platform Quran recitation and learning application featuring a React/TypeScript frontend, Python/Flask backend, and mobile components (React Native/Android/iOS). Existing functionalities include audio recording, recitation checking, caching, language toggles, and surah navigation, as evidenced in components like `audio-recorder.tsx`, `RecitationDetail.tsx`, and `quranApi.ts`. The enhancement aims to integrate advanced Quran reader features (e.g., Mushaf layouts, Tajweed colors, translations), recitation modes (e.g., AI voice search, mistake detection, peeking), listening experiences, goals tracking, and community elements, inspired by Tarteel-like functionality. The codebase emphasizes internationalization, theming, and mobile optimization, with documentation in `/docs/` and a core focus on memorization and recitation accuracy.

## 2. Scope
### In Scope
- **Quran Reader Enhancements:** Implementation of Mushaf layouts (Madani 1421 and IndoPak), Tajweed color coding, translations (long-press and Adaptive Mode), transliteration, bookmarks, and appearance controls.
- **Recitation Experience:** Development of interaction modes (Recite vs. Listen), AI voice search, follow-along, mistake detection (with Tashkeel option), color feedback, historical mistakes tracking, and audio privacy controls for premium users.
- **Listening Experience:** Addition of playback features (own recordings, speed/loop controls, range focus), 14 reciters, and offline audio downloads.
- **Goals, Progress, and Activity:** Integration of goals/presets (e.g., Surah al-Kahf Fridays), streaks, badges, memorization tracking, and off-platform session logging.
- **Community and Settings:** Features for groups, leaderboards, notifications, multi-language UI, and platform-specific customizations.
- **Monetization:** Free tier (e.g., voice search, streaks) and premium gating for advanced features.

### Out of Scope
- Major architectural overhauls beyond existing integrations.
- Expansion to unsupported platforms (e.g., desktop/web beyond current Capacitor setup).
- Changes to core CI/CD pipelines without approval.
- Any Git commits or deployments (as per user instructions).

### Key Assumptions
- Features will integrate with existing frontend components (e.g., `App.tsx`, `audio-recorder.tsx`) and backend APIs (e.g., `quranApi.ts`, `app.py`) without requiring major architectural changes.
- Mobile platforms (iOS/Android) are primary, with web as secondary, aligning with the current Capacitor configuration.
- Premium features will leverage existing settings/hooks (e.g., `useSettings.ts`) for gating, and audio processing will build on current recording services.

### Constraints
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript with Vite; must maintain mobile responsiveness and integrate with Capacitor for iOS/Android.
- **Backend:** Python/Flask; ensure API endpoints for recitation and audio handling scale for real-time features like mistake detection.
- **Performance:** Audio processing and layout rendering must be optimized for mobile devices, avoiding heavy computations on low-end hardware.
- **Security:** Handle audio recordings and user data compliantly, aligning with existing i18n and privacy features.
- **Licensing:** Open-source focus (LICENSE file present); ensure Quran content and third-party integrations comply with Islamic text standards.
- **CI/CD:** Use existing scripts (e.g., `dev-start.sh`, `Dockerfile`) for deployment; no new pipelines without approval.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Project Sponsor/Product Owner:** [Insert if known; e.g., Iqra al-Quran development team lead].
- **Development Team:** Frontend (React/TypeScript), Backend (Python/Flask), Mobile (React Native/Capacitor) engineers.
- **Users/End-Users:** Quran learners focused on memorization and recitation, including mobile users on iOS/Android.
- **Business Analyst:** Mary (me), facilitating requirements and documentation.
- **Other:** QA testers, UI/UX designers for accessibility and theming.
