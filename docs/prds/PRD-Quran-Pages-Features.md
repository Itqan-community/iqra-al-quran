# Project Brief: Enhancing Iqra al-Quran with Quran Pages Features

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Title:** Quran Pages Features Enhancement
**Prepared By:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Date:** October 13, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

### Objective
Create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for adding advanced Quran page features to Iqra al-Quran, including user stories, testable acceptance criteria, MoSCoW priorities, and a Linear-formatted delivery timeline, based on the provided feature descriptions.

### Context Summary
The Iqra al-Quran project is a multi-platform Quran recitation and learning application featuring a React/TypeScript frontend, Python/Flask backend, and mobile components (React Native/Android/iOS). Existing functionalities include audio recording, recitation checking, caching, language toggles, and surah navigation, as evidenced in components like `audio-recorder.tsx`, `RecitationDetail.tsx`, and `quranApi.ts`. The enhancement aims to integrate advanced Quran reader features (e.g., Mushaf layouts, Tajweed colors, translations), recitation modes (e.g., AI voice search, mistake detection, peeking), listening experiences, goals tracking, and community elements, inspired by Tarteel-like functionality. The codebase emphasizes internationalization, theming, and mobile optimization, with documentation in `/docs/` and a core focus on memorization and recitation accuracy.

## 2. Scope
### In Scope
- **Quran Reader Enhancements:** Implementation of Mushaf layouts (Madani 1421 and IndoPak), Tajweed color coding, translations (long-press and Adaptive Mode), transliteration, bookmarks, and appearance controls.
- **Recitation Experience:** Development of interaction modes (Recite vs. Listen), AI voice search, follow-along, mistake detection (with Tashkeel option), color feedback, historical mistakes tracking, and audio privacy controls for premium users.
- **Listening Experience:** Addition of playback features (own recordings, speed/loop controls, range focus), 14 reciters, and offline audio downloads.
- **Goals, Progress, and Activity:** Integration of goals/presets (e.g., Surah al-Kahf Fridays), streaks, badges, memorization tracking, and off-platform session logging.
- **Community and Settings:** Features for groups, leaderboards, notifications, multi-language UI, and platform-specific customizations.
- **Monetization:** Free tier (e.g., voice search, streaks) and premium gating for advanced features.

### Out of Scope
- Major architectural overhauls beyond existing integrations.
- Expansion to unsupported platforms (e.g., desktop/web beyond current Capacitor setup).
- Changes to core CI/CD pipelines without approval.
- Any Git commits or deployments (as per user instructions).

### Key Assumptions
- Features will integrate with existing frontend components (e.g., `App.tsx`, `audio-recorder.tsx`) and backend APIs (e.g., `quranApi.ts`, `app.py`) without requiring major architectural changes.
- Mobile platforms (iOS/Android) are primary, with web as secondary, aligning with the current Capacitor configuration.
- Premium features will leverage existing settings/hooks (e.g., `useSettings.ts`) for gating, and audio processing will build on current recording services.

### Constraints
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript with Vite; must maintain mobile responsiveness and integrate with Capacitor for iOS/Android.
- **Backend:** Python/Flask; ensure API endpoints for recitation and audio handling scale for real-time features like mistake detection.
- **Performance:** Audio processing and layout rendering must be optimized for mobile devices, avoiding heavy computations on low-end hardware.
- **Security:** Handle audio recordings and user data compliantly, aligning with existing i18n and privacy features.
- **Licensing:** Open-source focus (LICENSE file present); ensure Quran content and third-party integrations comply with Islamic text standards.
- **CI/CD:** Use existing scripts (e.g., `dev-start.sh`, `Dockerfile`) for deployment; no new pipelines without approval.

## 3. Stakeholders
- **Project Sponsor/Product Owner:** [Insert if known; e.g., Iqra al-Quran development team lead].
- **Development Team:** Frontend (React/TypeScript), Backend (Python/Flask), Mobile (React Native/Capacitor) engineers.
- **Users/End-Users:** Quran learners focused on memorization and recitation, including mobile users on iOS/Android.
- **Business Analyst:** Mary (me), facilitating requirements and documentation.
- **Other:** QA testers, UI/UX designers for accessibility and theming.

## 4. Requirements and User Stories
### High-Level Requirements
- Users can select and switch between Mushaf layouts and toggle Tajweed colors seamlessly.
- Recitation modes support AI-driven features like voice search and mistake detection.
- Listening and progress tracking enhance user engagement without compromising performance.
- Community and customization features promote inclusivity and usability.

- **Recitation:** Mode toggle updates UI affordances; AI voice search matches ayah within seconds; Mistake detection highlights errors inline; Peeking shows first word of next verse.
- **Listening:** Playback controls (speed, loop) are responsive; Reciter switching persists selection; Offline downloads manage storage correctly.
- **Goals/Progress:** Preset goals (e.g., Surah al-Kahf) create scheduled plans; Streaks update daily; Memorization tracker drills to word level.
- **Community/Settings:** Language changes localize UI instantly; Notifications schedule per goals; Platform docs clarify iOS/Android scope.

## 5. MoSCoW Priorities
- **Must-Have:** Core Quran Reader features (layouts, Tajweed, basic translations) and essential recitation modes (AI voice search, follow-along) – critical for basic functionality.
- **Should-Have:** Mistake detection, color feedback, listening playback, goals/streaks – important for engagement but not launch-blocking.
- **Could-Have:** Premium features (historical mistakes, audio deletion), advanced community elements (leaderboards), and multi-language UI – nice-to-have for enhancement.
- **Won't-Have:** Desktop/web expansions beyond current setup, major backend overhauls, or unsupported Qirā'āt beyond Hafs ʽĀṣim.

## 6. Timeline (Linear-Formatted Delivery)
This timeline assumes a 12-week development cycle, broken into sprints for iterative delivery. Milestones align with MoSCoW priorities.

- **Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-3):** Planning & Must-Haves – Review codebase, draft user stories, implement core Quran Reader (layouts, Tajweed). Milestone: Basic layout switching functional.
- **Sprint 2 (Weeks 4-6):** Should-Haves – Develop recitation modes (AI search, mistake detection), listening playback. Milestone: Voice search and feedback integrated.
- **Sprint 3 (Weeks 7-9):** Could-Haves – Add goals/tracking, community features, premium gating. Milestone: Streaks and leaderboards operational.
- **Sprint 4 (Weeks 10-12):** Testing & Polish – Full testing, UI/UX refinements, documentation updates. Milestone: PRD complete, features verified, ready for review.
- **Overall Deadline:** End of Week 12 for initial release; buffer for iterations.

## 7. Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Integration challenges with existing components (e.g., audio-recorder.tsx). **Mitigation:** Conduct code reviews and use existing hooks for seamless updates.
- **Risk:** Performance issues on mobile devices. **Mitigation:** Optimize audio processing and test on low-end hardware early.
- **Risk:** Scope creep from premium features. **Mitigation:** Stick to MoSCoW priorities and gate non-essential items.
- **Risk:** User data privacy concerns. **Mitigation:** Align with existing security protocols and ensure compliance.

## 8. Success Metrics
- User engagement: Increase in daily active users for recitation features by 20%.
- Feature adoption: 80% of users utilizing at least one new Quran Reader or recitation tool within the first month.
- Performance: <5% crash rate on iOS/Android; layout switches complete in <2 seconds.
- Feedback: Positive ratings in app stores for new memorization aids.

## 9. Next Steps and Recommendations
- **Immediate:** Share this brief for team review and confirm any adjustments.
- **Short-Term:** Assign Linear tickets based on sprints; begin development with must-haves.
- **Recommendations:** Conduct user testing sessions for accessibility (e.g., Tajweed colors); explore partnerships for additional reciters if budget allows.
- **Open Questions:** Do we need to elicit more details on specific integrations or premium pricing models?

This project brief is structured for clarity and actionability. If you'd like to refine any section, run additional commands (e.g., *brainstorm for ideation), or proceed to documentation output, just let me know—I'm here to iterate collaboratively!
