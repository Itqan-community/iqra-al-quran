# Story 17: Backend APIs

## Epic
Epic-6-Technical-Foundation

## User Story
As a backend developer, I want to implement Flask REST APIs for recitation analysis and user progress so that the frontend can interact seamlessly.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create endpoints for audio upload and analysis.
- Integrate with database for progress tracking.
- Ensure low-latency responses (<500ms for analysis).
- Edge cases: Handle large audio files with chunking and timeout protection.
- API versioning for backward compatibility.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse.

## Estimate
3 weeks

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Frontend architecture
- Database schema design
- Authentication system (JWT)
- Audio processing service
- Error handling framework

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests with database
- Load testing for concurrent users
- Security testing for authentication
- API documentation with Swagger

## User Impact
Enables seamless data flow between user actions and backend processing, ensuring progress tracking and recitation analysis work reliably to support learning goals.

## Risks
- Database performance under high load
- Audio processing timeouts for large files
- Security vulnerabilities in file upload handling

## Notes
Focus on scalable API design.
