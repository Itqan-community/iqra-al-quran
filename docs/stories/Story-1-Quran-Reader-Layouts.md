## Epic
Epic-1-Quran-Reader-Enhancements

## User Story
As a Quran reader, I want to choose between Madani 1421 and IndoPak layouts so that I can view the text in my preferred Mushaf style.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can select layout from Settings â†’ Mushaf Layout.
- Layout switch updates page segmentation instantly without app reload.
- Default layout persists across sessions.
- Edge cases: Handle corrupted layout preferences gracefully with fallback to default.
- Layout switching works on slow devices without UI freezing.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- UI component library setup
- Settings persistence mechanism

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for layout switching logic
- UI tests for instant updates
- Performance tests on low-end devices

## User Impact
Enhances memorization by allowing users to practice with their familiar Mushaf style, reducing cognitive load and improving focus during recitation sessions.

## Risks
- Layout rendering performance on older devices
- Potential UI inconsistencies between layouts

## Notes
Align with existing UI components.
