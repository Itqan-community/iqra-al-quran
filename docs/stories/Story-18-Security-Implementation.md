# Story 18: Security Implementation

## Epic
Epic-6-Technical-Foundation

## User Story
As a security engineer, I want to implement encryption for audio data and JWT for APIs so that user privacy is protected at every layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Encrypt audio locally before upload.
- Use JWT for authentication.
- Comply with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).
- Edge cases: Handle encryption key rotation and recovery.
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations.
- Secure data transmission with TLS 1.3.
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- User consent management for data collection.
- Secure storage of user credentials and personal data.
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection.
- Audit logging for security events.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Backend APIs story (Story-17)
- Encryption key management system
- Authentication service infrastructure
- Security audit tools
- Compliance monitoring system

## Testing Notes
- Security penetration testing
- Encryption/decryption performance tests
- Authentication flow testing
- Compliance validation testing
- Vulnerability scanning automation

## User Impact
Protects user privacy and builds trust by securing personal recitation data and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations, creating a safe environment for spiritual practice and learning.

## Risks
- Security vulnerabilities exposing user data
- Performance impact of encryption overhead
- Compliance failures leading to legal issues

## Notes
Defense in depth for religious content.
