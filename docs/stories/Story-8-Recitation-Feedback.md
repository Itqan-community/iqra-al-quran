# Story 8: Recitation Feedback

## Epic
Epic-2-Recitation-Experience

## User Story
As a memorizer, I want color-coded feedback and history highlights so that I can track progress visually.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Colors: red error, green correct, yellow diacritics, brown peeked.
- History highlights toggle off.
- Edge cases: Handle overlapping feedback colors with priority system.
- Colorblind accessibility: Alternative patterns/shapes for colors.
- Feedback appears within 200ms of detection.
- Clear visual distinction between feedback types.
- History can be filtered by feedback type.
- Feedback intensity adjustable (subtle to prominent).
- Export feedback history for progress analysis.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
Medium

## Dependencies
- Mistake detection story (Story-7)
- Color accessibility system
- Feedback history database
- UI rendering engine
- Export functionality

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for feedback color logic
- Accessibility tests for color alternatives
- Performance tests for real-time feedback
- User testing for feedback clarity
- Integration tests with mistake detection

## User Impact
Accelerates learning by providing immediate visual feedback on recitation accuracy, helping users identify and correct mistakes in real-time, leading to faster improvement and increased confidence.

## Risks
- Feedback overload causing user distraction
- Color accessibility issues for visually impaired users
- Performance impact of real-time rendering

## Notes
Consistent color semantics.
