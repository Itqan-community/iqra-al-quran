# Story 5: Recitation Modes

## Epic
Epic-2-Recitation-Experience

## User Story
As a reciter, I want to switch between Recite and Listen modes via settings or in-app controls so that I can adapt my interaction style.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Toggle via Settings or green mic/play button.
- Mode changes update UI affordances and state.
- Edge cases: Handle mode switching during active recording/playback.
- Visual feedback clearly indicates current mode.
- Mode preference persists across app sessions.
- Smooth transition between modes without data loss.
- Accessibility: Screen reader announces mode changes.
- Performance: Mode switching is instantaneous (<100ms).

## Estimate
1 week

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Audio recording system
- UI state management
- Settings persistence
- Audio playback engine
- Mode switching logic

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for mode switching logic
- Integration tests with audio systems
- Performance tests for mode transitions
- Accessibility tests for mode indicators
- User experience testing for mode clarity

## User Impact
Provides flexible learning approaches by allowing users to switch between active recitation practice and passive listening, accommodating different learning styles and study preferences.

## Risks
- Audio system conflicts during mode switching
- User confusion about current mode
- Data loss during transitions

## Notes
Integrate with existing audio recorder.
