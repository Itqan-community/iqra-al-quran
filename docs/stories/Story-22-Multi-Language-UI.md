## Epic
Epic-1-Quran-Reader-Enhancements

## User Story
As a global user, I want the app interface in my preferred language so that I can navigate and use features comfortably in my native language.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Support for 12 languages: EN, AR, FR, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia, RU, TR, ES, DE, Hausa, UR, PT
- Language selection in Settings with immediate UI update
- All menus, buttons, and messages localized
- Right-to-left (RTL) support for Arabic and Urdu
- Edge cases: Handle missing translations with fallback to English
- Language preference persists across sessions
- Dynamic loading of language packs
- Proper text formatting for different languages

## Estimate
3 weeks

## Priority
Medium

## Dependencies
- i18n localization framework
- Translation management system
- RTL layout support library
- Settings persistence system
- UI component internationalization

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for translation key resolution
- UI tests for all supported languages
- RTL layout testing for Arabic/Urdu
- Performance tests for language switching
- Translation completeness validation

## User Impact
Makes the app accessible to global Muslim community by providing native language support, significantly improving user experience and adoption in non-English speaking regions.

## Risks
- Translation quality and cultural appropriateness
- RTL layout complexity affecting UI consistency
- Performance impact of large translation files

## Notes
Aligns with PRD user story 16 for multi-language support.
