## Epic
Epic-3-Listening-Goals-Community

## User Story
As a listener, I want to play back my recordings with speed/loop controls and focus on ranges so that I can review effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Playback controls responsive.
- Loop segments and set speed.
- Edge cases: Handle corrupted audio files gracefully.
- Speed range: 0.5x to 2.0x with 0.1x increments.
- Loop points can be set by tapping start/end positions.
- Background playback continues when app is minimized.
- Resume playback from last position after app restart.
- Visual waveform shows current position and loop points.
- Keyboard shortcuts for common playback controls.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
Low

## Dependencies
- Audio playback engine
- Waveform visualization library
- Background audio service
- Storage persistence system
- Keyboard input handling

## Testing Notes
- Unit tests for playback controls
- Performance tests for audio processing
- Integration tests with background services
- User experience tests for control responsiveness
- Compatibility tests across devices

## User Impact
Enhances memorization by allowing precise control over audio playback, enabling users to focus on difficult passages through looping and speed adjustment, significantly improving learning efficiency.

## Risks
- Audio quality degradation at different speeds
- Battery drain from continuous playback
- Compatibility issues with different audio formats

## Notes
Integrate with existing player.
