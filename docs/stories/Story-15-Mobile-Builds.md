## Epic
Epic-5-Mobile-Development

## User Story
As a developer, I want to build and deploy Android and iOS apps via Expo so that users can install the app on mobile devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Use Expo EAS for builds.
- Generate APK/IPA files.
- Test on emulators and devices.
- Edge cases: Handle build failures with detailed error reporting.
- Support multiple build variants (development, staging, production).
- Automated testing pipeline for each build.
- Code signing and certificate management.
- Build artifacts stored securely with version tracking.
- Performance profiling for each build.
- Compatibility testing across different OS versions.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Expo setup story (Story-14)
- Code signing certificates
- Build pipeline infrastructure
- Testing device farm
- App store deployment accounts

## Testing Notes
- Automated build verification tests
- Device compatibility testing
- Performance profiling on builds
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- App store submission validation

## User Impact
Enables users to access the app on their mobile devices with native performance and features, providing seamless Quran learning experience optimized for touch interfaces and mobile usage patterns.

## Risks
- Build failures blocking releases
- Platform-specific compatibility issues
- App store rejection due to policy violations

## Notes
Ensure compatibility with audio features.
