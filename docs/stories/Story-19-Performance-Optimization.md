# Story 19: Performance Optimization

## Epic
Epic-6-Technical-Foundation

## User Story
As a performance engineer, I want to optimize lazy loading, caching, and on-device AI so that the app runs smoothly on mobile devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement caching for offline Quran content.
- Optimize audio processing for low-end hardware.
- Monitor performance metrics.
- Edge cases: Handle cache corruption and automatic recovery.
- Lazy loading for non-critical UI components.
- Memory usage optimization with garbage collection tuning.
- Network request optimization with compression and batching.
- Database query optimization with indexing strategies.
- Image and asset optimization for faster loading.
- Performance budgets and automated performance testing.
- Progressive loading for large datasets.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
Medium

## Dependencies
- AI integration story (Story-6, Story-7)
- Performance monitoring tools
- Caching infrastructure
- Database optimization tools
- CDN and asset delivery system

## Testing Notes
- Load testing under various conditions
- Performance benchmarking across devices
- Memory leak detection testing
- Network optimization validation
- User experience performance testing

## User Impact
Ensures smooth and responsive app experience across all devices, enabling uninterrupted learning sessions and reducing frustration from slow loading or laggy interactions.

## Risks
- Over-optimization causing code complexity
- Performance improvements breaking existing functionality
- Resource optimization conflicts with feature requirements

## Notes
Cross-stack focus for holistic optimization.
