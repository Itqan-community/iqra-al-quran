## Epic
Epic-5-Mobile-Development

## User Story
As a developer, I want to set up Expo for Android and iOS development so that I can build native mobile apps efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Install Expo CLI and initialize project.
- Configure app.json for Android/iOS.
- Integrate with existing React/TypeScript frontend.
- Edge cases: Handle Expo SDK version conflicts and dependency issues.
- Development environment works on both macOS and Windows.

## Estimate
1 week

## Priority
High

## Dependencies
- Frontend architecture
- Node.js environment setup
- React/TypeScript codebase
- Mobile development certificates

## Testing Notes
- Test Expo setup on different operating systems
- Verify hot reload functionality
- Test basic app compilation for both platforms

## User Impact
Enables rapid mobile development, allowing users to access Quran learning features natively on their phones with better performance and offline capabilities.

## Risks
- Expo SDK limitations may restrict native functionality
- Version compatibility issues between Expo and React Native
- Platform-specific build issues

## Notes
Use Expo for rapid prototyping.
