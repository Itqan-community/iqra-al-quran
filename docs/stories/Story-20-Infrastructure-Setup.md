# Story 20: Infrastructure Setup

## Epic
Epic-6-Technical-Foundation

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up Docker containers and Railway deployment so that the app scales cost-effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Containerize backend and AI services.
- Deploy to Railway with CI/CD.
- Monitor costs and performance.
- Edge cases: Handle deployment failures with rollback mechanisms.
- Auto-scaling based on traffic and resource usage.
- Health checks and service monitoring with alerts.
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures.
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod).
- Load balancing and traffic distribution.
- Cost optimization with resource scheduling.
- Security scanning for container vulnerabilities.

## Estimate
2 weeks

## Priority
Low

## Dependencies
- Backend APIs story (Story-17)
- Container orchestration platform
- CI/CD pipeline tools
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Backup and disaster recovery systems

## Testing Notes
- Infrastructure deployment testing
- Disaster recovery simulation tests
- Scalability and load testing
- Security configuration validation
- Cost optimization verification

## User Impact
Provides reliable and scalable platform foundation that ensures consistent app availability and performance, supporting users' learning journey without technical interruptions.

## Risks
- Infrastructure costs exceeding budget
- Deployment failures causing service outages
- Scalability bottlenecks during peak usage

## Notes
Balance technical ideals with financial reality.
