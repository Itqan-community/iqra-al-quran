# Epic 6: Technical Foundation

## Overview
This epic encompasses the core technical infrastructure including backend APIs, security implementation, performance optimization, and infrastructure setup that supports all user-facing features.

## Key Features
- Backend REST API development
- Security and encryption implementation
- Performance optimization across the stack
- Infrastructure setup and deployment
- Monitoring and analytics

## Priority
Must-Have (Backend/Security), Should-Have (Performance/Infrastructure)

## User Stories
- As a backend developer, I want REST APIs so that frontend can interact with services.
- As a security engineer, I want encryption so that user data is protected.
- As a performance engineer, I want optimization so that the app runs smoothly.
- As a DevOps engineer, I want infrastructure so that the app scales reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
- APIs handle recitation analysis; Security protects user data; Performance meets targets; Infrastructure supports scaling.

## Timeline
Sprint 2-4 (Weeks 4-12)

## Risks
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Infrastructure costs
- Integration complexity
